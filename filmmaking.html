    Fire Escape Films has two regular production cycles: <br>
    (i) the Fall Production Cycle, and <br>
    (ii) the Winter - Spring Production Cycle. <br><br>
    We put up open calls for each cycle about a month before they begin. These are communicated through our Instagram, and through our listhost (sign up HERE!).<br><br>
    Extemporaneous applications are considered on a case by case basis (only for Indie Film Projects). If you wish to propose one, contact us through email. 
  </p>

  <p class="testimonial-text" style="color: black; text-indent: 2em;">
    We have three different types of projects that we support: <br><br>
    (i) <b>Indie Projects</b>: Short films that don't require a ton of funding or crew. Smaller scale projects that are given more flexibility. Up to 10 minutes. <br><br>
    (ii) <b>Regular Projects</b>: Short films that are regularly supported by Fire Escape Films. These are the ones that we have supported for the longest, and the ones that have all of the classic FE resources and support. Up to 20 minutes. <br><br>
    (iii) <b>Extended Projects</b>: Short films (that may not be so short). Only for seasoned FE members, who are looking to do a more ambitious project. Up to 25 minutes.
