      <p class="testimonial-text" style = "color: black;">Fire Escape Films has two regular production cycles: (i) the Fall Production Cycle, and the (ii) Winter - Spring Production Cycle. We put up open calls for each cycle about a month before they begin. These are communicated through our Instagram, and through our listhost (sign up HERE!). Extemporaneous applications are considered on a case by case basis, and only for Indie Film Projects. If you wish to propose one, contact us through email.
