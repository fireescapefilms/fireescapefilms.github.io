description: "Ideal for Sony A7S3 + Atomos ProRes RAW recording. You need a large drive to store these raw files. If you want to do color grading in Davinci Resolve, you would need the Raw Converter software to convert Apple ProRes RAW files to C-DNG files. Note that this drive requires a dedicated power supply."
