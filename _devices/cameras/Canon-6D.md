description: "Canon 6D is similar to 5D in terms of usage and capabilities. For videos, it supports up to 1080p resolution and mainly record in Rec 709 color profile. It does not support the newer C-LOG profile, and you will expect to use the direct out-of-camera color with very limited color grading room in post. It can be a limitation for advanced users but a good thing for beginners who have no idea how to properly color grade a clip. Canon has quite good color science without any color grading."
