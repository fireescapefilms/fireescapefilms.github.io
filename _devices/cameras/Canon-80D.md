description: "Canon 80D has an APS-C sensor, which is not full-frame compared to Canon 5D and 6D, but is more beginner friendly. It supports touch screen. For videos, it supports up to 1080p resolution and mainly record in Rec 709 color profile. It does not support the newer C-LOG profile, and you will expect to use the direct out-of-camera color with very limited color grading room in post. It can be a limitation for advanced users but a good thing for beginners who have no idea how to properly color grade a clip. Canon has quite good color science without any color grading."
