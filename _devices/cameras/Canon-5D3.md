description: "Canon 5D Mark III is a quite good option for photography. For videos, it supports up to 1080p resolution and mainly record in Rec 709 color profile. It does not support the newer C-LOG profile, and you will expect to use the direct out-of-camera color with very limited color grading room in post. It can be a limitation for advanced users but a good thing for beginners who have no idea how to properly color grade a clip. Canon has quite good color science without any color grading."
