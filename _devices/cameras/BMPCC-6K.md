description: "This is an old version of BMPCC, which uses Canon LP-E6 batteries. The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K can record in Blackmagic RAW and ProRes quality, but takes a large amount of storage space. We recommend using external recording or very large SD cards to make your life easier. It is compatible with Canon lenses."
