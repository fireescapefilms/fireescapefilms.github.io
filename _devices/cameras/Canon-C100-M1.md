description: "Our oldest cinema camera Canon C100 Mark I. If you have never experienced a cinema camera with lots of buttons on the body, this is a good place to start with. If you just start making a movie, this camera has very small file sizes and allows you to record up to 1080p. It features a Super 35mm CMOS sensor that delivers excellent image quality and low-light performance. The C100 offers advanced video features, including the ability to shoot 1080p video at up to 60 frames per second and a wide dynamic range of up to 12 stops. It also features dual pixel autofocus technology for fast and accurate autofocus, as well as a built-in ND filter for better exposure control."
