description: "The Pro version uses NP-F570 batteries, which is different from our Canon LP-E6 batteries. To top their previous achievement with the Pocket Cinema Camera 6K, Blackmagic Design adds an even more full-featured, compact Super35 camera to their cine-style line with the Pocket Cinema Camera 6K Pro."
