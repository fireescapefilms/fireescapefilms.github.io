      <p>Following the success of our first Diaspora Film Festival last spring (April 2025), 
        which focused on the East Asian diaspora, the <strong>Diaspora Film Festival returns 
          with a new theme: Latin American Diaspora</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>We invite <strong>young filmmakers</strong> to showcase their work at this year’s festival. 
        Selected films will be screened at a live event hosted at International House at the 
        University of Chicago on May 8, 2026, followed by a panel discussion and Q&A with the filmmakers. 
        This festival will celebrate the creativity and voices of student artists exploring themes of 
        identity, migration, and cultural heritage.
